# 16 Bytes Style Guide

This repository contains the 16 Bytes style guide.

You might be wondering why we have a style guide.
Well, we're a small team and we want to make sure we're all on the same page when it comes to writing code.

We also want to make sure that our code is easy to read and understand.

## WIP

This style guide is still a work in progress and will be updated as we go.
